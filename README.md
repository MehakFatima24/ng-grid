## ⚡ App Design 

This is an Angular 13 application that displays the post data from jsonplaceholder API in 100x100 Material UI grid.
The application has a configuration file so the user can alter the size of the grid if need be. The application hierarchy includes separate folders for Models, Services, Components etc so that the code remains maintainable as well as re-usable if the code base grows. The design ensures there's minimal coupling between the components. While I don't deem myself a design expert but I have added some cool animations to the app because why not? 😉
